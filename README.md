Google Scripts

This repo contains all of the Google Apps Script scripts I wrote to handle class logistics.
We use these scripts every time we grade and they are well-documented.
These scripts came out of a need to make the grading and comment process more efficient and
collaborative.
Due to their use, the grading process has become much more scalable and the class has been
able to expand organically without sacrificing the attention students receive.
